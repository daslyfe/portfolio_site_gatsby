For this project, I had to take design mockups and turn them into a responsive Shopify website for a skin care brand. 

- created custom Liquid plugins for user friendly page editing
- respondive / mobile friendly ecommerce site
 
<a class="url" href="https://freshchemistry.com/">>Link to Website</a>
