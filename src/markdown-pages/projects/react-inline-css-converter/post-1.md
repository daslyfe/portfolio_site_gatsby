This is a realtime converter that you can use to change CSS into JSX style syntax or vice versa. I made this because sometimes I test using inline styles and later want to convert them into CSS syntax or vice versa, and manually changing the syntax is time consuming.

# Features: 
- syntax highlighting
- comment conversion //comment -> /*comment*/
- rule conversion and syntax conversion 
-  converted results show in realtime as you are typing/pasting
