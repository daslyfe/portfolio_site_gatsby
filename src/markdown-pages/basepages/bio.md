<h1> About Me: </h1>

<div class="ml-8 mt-2">
I love puzzles and solving problems, and coding is something I can’t help but love doing. I am mostly self taught, but have had a good amount of work experience, solid mentorship, as well as personal projects. There is still a lot that I want to learn, and I am looking for the opportunity to grow and collaborate with other coders.
